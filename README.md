## <b>PROJECT NAME</b>
Emotion Recognition Web App (face_it) <br>
🔗 <a href="https://face-it.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Open face_it App</a> <br>
🔗 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST0ZGqhGCCw" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>



## <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
• Developed an AI-powered web application that recognizes human emotions from facial expressions in real time. <br>
• Collaborated in a 5-person team, focusing on both model performance (deep learning, bias reduction) and scalable deployment (Streamlit frontend + FastAPI backend in Docker). <br>
• Implemented a pipeline where user-uploaded images are preprocessed (grayscale, resize, normalize) and classified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with ResNet50. <br>
• Enhanced explainability & trust with Grad-CAM visual heatmaps and SHAP feature importance to interpret model predictions. <br>


## <b>GOAL</b>
• Design an accurate, fair, and explainable AI system, with special focus on reducing misclassifications of subtle emotions (e.g., Fear vs. Disgust). Deliver a solution that’s interpretable, production-ready, and user-friendly. <br>


## <b>DATASET</b>
• FER-2013 dataset (~40k labeled face images, PNG/JPG) <br>
• Applied augmentation to rebalance underrepresented classes <br>
• Seven emotion categories: <br>
😊 Happiness | 😢 Sadness | 😱 Fear | 😡 Anger | 🤢 Disgust | 😲 Surprise | 😐 Neutral <br>

📸 Upload face images for recognition <br>
🧹 Automated preprocessing pipeline (grayscale, resize, normalization) <br>
🤖 Deep learning classification into 7 emotions (CNN + ResNet50) <br>
🪞 Explainability with Grad-CAM & SHAP <br>
⚡ Full-stack deployment: Streamlit frontend + FastAPI backend + Docker <br>
